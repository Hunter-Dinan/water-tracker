# Water Tracker

This program is a learning project that I am undertaking to learn more about programming. It is a program that tracks water intake and shows daily, weekly, monthly and yearly views of water consumption. There is a social section where you can add friends and check their water consumption as well.

Follows PEP 8 and PEP 257 style guides and conventions.

Cross-Platform, developed in Python using Kivy GUI Framework.
